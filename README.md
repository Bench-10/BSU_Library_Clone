## 📖 Overview

The **Batangas State University Library System** serves as an essential resource providing access to academic resources for students, faculty, and library staff. However, its current design is outdated, lacks usability, and does not cater to modern user needs. Poor visual hierarchy, limited search features, and lack of responsiveness hinder users—primarily students and faculty—from efficiently finding and managing academic materials.  

**Rlibrary+** addresses these issues by enhancing the system with a modern UI/UX, real-time catalog, digital borrowing, and analytics integration to provide a smoother, more intelligent library experience.
